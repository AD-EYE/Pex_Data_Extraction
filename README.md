This repository contains code for the _**AD-EYE testbed for Automated Driving and Intelligent Transportation Systems**_, located at KTH Campus Valhallavägen, designed and developed by Naveen Mohan and others. <br><br>

The specific contents of this repository enable the extraction of road and lane network definitions from a PreScan compatible .pex format, and output it into CSV files that comply with the format used by Autoware's Vector maps. <br>
The code in this repository was first created as part of a Embedded Systems capstone course at KTH in 2018. <br><br>
