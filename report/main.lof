Images from \cite {Lanelet3}, in which the article authors demonstrate that \textit {OpenDRIVE} maps can be discretized to form lanelet maps.\relax }}{5}{figure.caption.6}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Overview of the not-yet-released \textit {Autoware Maps Format} described in \cite {AutowareMaps2}. The new format will reduce some of the redundancies in the vector map system by defining the lane width at each waypoint, rather than defining two parallel lines to represent the edges of the lane.\relax }}{6}{figure.caption.7}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {6}{\ignorespaces Comparison of two methods for approximating parallel Bezier curves. In black: the progenitor curve with its defining control points shown as circles connected by dashed lines. In red: approximation using the Tiller-Hanson method, with the associated control points shown as circles. In blue: approximation using a purely numerical method. This method was chosen for the vector map software.\relax }}{11}{figure.caption.11}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {7}{\ignorespaces UML class diagram of the Abstract Factory design pattern used in the vector mapping subsystem. The \texttt {VectorMap} class instantiates a \texttt {VMList} object for each type of \texttt {VMObject}. The class declared when instantiating \texttt {VMList} determines the behavior of the concrete factory created. The documentation for this class can be seen in Figure \ref {fig:doc}.\relax }}{12}{figure.caption.12}
